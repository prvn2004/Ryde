<h3 align="center">Full Stack Ride Booking Application</h3>

<p>This project is developed for a group hackathon workshop by team members <a href="https://github.com/MEHULSIRVI">Mehul Sirvi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prvn2002">Praveen Kumar</a>.</p>

Built with React Native for handling the user interface, Google Maps for rendering maps with directions, stripe for
handling payments, serverless Postgres for managing databases, and styled with TailwindCSS, Ryde is a perfect
mobile app. The primary goal of this project is to implement various features of full-stack
mobile application development.
